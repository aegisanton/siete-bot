Siete Bot is a Discord Bot made specifically for the GBF crew Luminosity. The creator of the bot is the crew captain Anton.

After the 8th anniversary update for GBF, the crew island resort feature made it apparent that the oldschool way of using Google Sheets to track member contributions would be way too impractical. Siete Bot was created to make it easy to quickly and easily note down your contributions without the need to leave Discord where all of the communication takes place. Having a custom bot also enables the addition of any features that the crew might want! 

Siete Bot currently supports the following features:
  * Profile for crew members
  * Ability for crew members to update their spark progress and support summons
  * Ability to register donations to the island resort feature

Furthermore, these features are planned in some way or another:
  * Twitter interactions for raids
  * Smoother organization for crew events like raid trains and co-op rooms
  * Guild Wars / Unite and Fight features
  * Highlighting of achievements
